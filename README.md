Max sum of element

The program is designed to find the line with the largest sum of elements in a file.

The user inputs the file path, and the result is displayed in the console. 
The program handles the following file content scenarios:
- integer or decimal numbers, including negative values;
- multiple lines with the maximum sum of elements (a message stating that there are several "maximum" lines);
- several corrupted lines, for example, containing letters (a list of indices of the corrupted lines will also be displayed);
- all lines are corrupted (a message will be displayed stating that all lines are corrupted);
- all lines are the same (a message will be displayed stating that all lines are identical);
- an empty or missing file (a corresponding message will be displayed).
